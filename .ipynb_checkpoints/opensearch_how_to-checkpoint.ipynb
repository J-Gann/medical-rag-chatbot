Understanding the strengths of each technique and optimizing the relevant parameters are essential to their implementation. UF-DCE MRI has now shifted from research protocols to becoming a part of clinical scan protocols for breast cancer. UF-DCE MRI is expected to compensate for the low specificity of abbreviated MRI by adding kinetic information from the upslope of the time-intensity curve. Because kinetic information from UF-DCE MRI is obtained from the shape and timing of the initial upslope, various new kinetic parameters have been proposed. These parameters may be associated with receptor status or prognostic markers for breast cancer. In addition to the diagnosis of malignant lesions, more emphasis has been placed on predicting and evaluating treatment response because hyper-vascularity is linked to the aggressiveness of breast cancers. In clinical practice, it is important to note that breast lesion images obtained from UF-DCE MRI are slightly different from those obtained by conventional DCE MRI in terms of morphology. A major benefit of using UF-DCE MRI is avoidance of the marked or moderate background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) that can obscure the target enhancing lesions. BPE is less prominent in the earlier phases of UF-DCE MRI, which offers better lesion-to-noise contrast. The excellent contrast of early-enhancing vessels provides a key to understanding the detailed pathological structure of tumor-associated vessels. UF-DCE MRI is normally accompanied by a large volume of image data for which automated/artificial intelligence-based processing is expected to be useful. In this review, both the theoretical and practical aspects of UF-DCE MRI are summarized.

Purpose To explore the potential benefit of artificial intelligence (AI) assistance in the detection of thoracic abnormalities on chest radiographs by evaluating the performance of radiologists with different levels of expertise, with and without AI assistance. Materials and Methods Patients who underwent both chest radiography and thoracic CT within 72 hours between January 2010 and December 2020 in a French public hospital were screened retrospectively. Radiographs were randomly included until reaching 500 radiographs, with about 50% of radiographs having abnormal findings. A senior thoracic radiologist annotated the radiographs for five abnormalities (pneumothorax, pleural effusion, consolidation, mediastinal and hilar mass, lung nodule) based on the corresponding CT results (ground truth). A total of 12 readers (four thoracic radiologists, four general radiologists, four radiology residents) read half the radiographs without AI and half the radiographs with AI (ChestView; Gleamer). Changes in sensitivity and specificity were measured using paired <i>t</i> tests. Results The study included 500 patients (mean age, 54 years \\u00b1 19 [SD]; 261 female, 239 male), with 522 abnormalities visible on 241 radiographs. On average, for all readers, AI use resulted in an absolute increase in sensitivity of 26% (95% CI: 20, 32), 14% (95% CI: 11, 17), 12% (95% CI: 10, 14), 8.5% (95% CI: 6, 11), and 5.9% (95% CI: 4, 8) for pneumothorax, consolidation, nodule, pleural effusion, and mediastinal and hilar mass, respectively (<i>P</i> < .001). Specificity increased with AI assistance (3.9% [95% CI: 3.2, 4.6], 3.7% [95% CI: 3, 4.4], 2.9% [95% CI: 2.3, 3.5], and 2.1% [95% CI: 1.6, 2.6] for pleural effusion, mediastinal and hilar mass, consolidation, and nodule, respectively), except in the diagnosis of pneumothorax (-0.2%; 95% CI: -0.36, -0.04; <i>P</i> = .01). The mean reading time was 81 seconds without AI versus 56 seconds with AI (31% decrease, <i>P</i> < .001). Conclusion AI-assisted chest radiography interpretation resulted in absolute increases in sensitivity for all radiologists of various levels of expertise and reduced the reading times; specificity increased with AI, except in the diagnosis of pneumothorax. \\u00a9 RSNA, 2023 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i>\"}},{\"_index\":\"pub_med\",\"_id\":\"axwrBI0BZKko4otC1atk\",\"_score\":1.0,\"_source\":{    \"id\": \"38084894\",    \"title\": \"Prognostic Value of a Novel Artificial Intelligence-Based Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography-Derived Ischemia Algorithm for Patients with Suspected Coronary Artery Disease.\",    \"text\": \"Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging is used to diagnose patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). A novel artificial-intelligence-guided quantitative computed tomography ischemia algorithm (AI-QCTischemia) aims to identify myocardial ischemia directly from CTA images and may be helpful to improve risk stratification. The aims were 1) the prognostic value of AI-QCTischemia among symptomatic patients with suspected CAD entering diagnostic imaging with coronary CTA, and 2) the prognostic value of AI-QCTischemia separately among patients with no/non-obstructive CAD (\\u226450% visual diameter stenosis) and obstructive CAD (>50% visual diameter stenosis). For this cohort study, AI-QCTischemia was calculated by blinded analysts among patients with suspected CAD undergoing coronary CTA. The primary endpoint was the composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or unstable angina pectoris (uAP) (median follow-up 6.9 years). 1880/2271 (83%) patients were analyzable by AI-QCTischemia.

It is important to note that after the 1.5 and 5.5 K temperatures changed repeatedly, the TE properties of the fiber demonstrated high stability. Based on the Seebeck effect and superior flexibility of the fibers, they can be integrated into a mask and wearable fabric for human respiration and body temperature monitoring. The superior thermal sensing performance of the TE fibers together with their natural flexibility and scalable fabrication endow them with promising applications in health-monitoring and intelligent medical systems.\"}}]}}"

Further, we probed into the factors influencing the performance of the modular SNN and found: (a). The modular SNN outperformed the uniform SNN more significantly when the number of neurons in the networks increased; (b). The performance of the modular SNNs increased as the number of modules dropped. These preliminary but novel findings suggest that modularity may help develop better artificial intelligence and brain-machine interfaces.

Understanding the strengths of each technique and optimizing the relevant parameters are essential to their implementation. UF-DCE MRI has now shifted from research protocols to becoming a part of clinical scan protocols for breast cancer. UF-DCE MRI is expected to compensate for the low specificity of abbreviated MRI by adding kinetic information from the upslope of the time-intensity curve. Because kinetic information from UF-DCE MRI is obtained from the shape and timing of the initial upslope, various new kinetic parameters have been proposed. These parameters may be associated with receptor status or prognostic markers for breast cancer. In addition to the diagnosis of malignant lesions, more emphasis has been placed on predicting and evaluating treatment response because hyper-vascularity is linked to the aggressiveness of breast cancers. In clinical practice, it is important to note that breast lesion images obtained from UF-DCE MRI are slightly different from those obtained by conventional DCE MRI in terms of morphology. A major benefit of using UF-DCE MRI is avoidance of the marked or moderate background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) that can obscure the target enhancing lesions. BPE is less prominent in the earlier phases of UF-DCE MRI, which offers better lesion-to-noise contrast. The excellent contrast of early-enhancing vessels provides a key to understanding the detailed pathological structure of tumor-associated vessels. UF-DCE MRI is normally accompanied by a large volume of image data for which automated/artificial intelligence-based processing is expected to be useful. In this review, both the theoretical and practical aspects of UF-DCE MRI are summarized.

Purpose To explore the potential benefit of artificial intelligence (AI) assistance in the detection of thoracic abnormalities on chest radiographs by evaluating the performance of radiologists with different levels of expertise, with and without AI assistance. Materials and Methods Patients who underwent both chest radiography and thoracic CT within 72 hours between January 2010 and December 2020 in a French public hospital were screened retrospectively. Radiographs were randomly included until reaching 500 radiographs, with about 50% of radiographs having abnormal findings. A senior thoracic radiologist annotated the radiographs for five abnormalities (pneumothorax, pleural effusion, consolidation, mediastinal and hilar mass, lung nodule) based on the corresponding CT results (ground truth). A total of 12 readers (four thoracic radiologists, four general radiologists, four radiology residents) read half the radiographs without AI and half the radiographs with AI (ChestView; Gleamer). Changes in sensitivity and specificity were measured using paired <i>t</i> tests. Results The study included 500 patients (mean age, 54 years \\u00b1 19 [SD]; 261 female, 239 male), with 522 abnormalities visible on 241 radiographs. On average, for all readers, AI use resulted in an absolute increase in sensitivity of 26% (95% CI: 20, 32), 14% (95% CI: 11, 17), 12% (95% CI: 10, 14), 8.5% (95% CI: 6, 11), and 5.9% (95% CI: 4, 8) for pneumothorax, consolidation, nodule, pleural effusion, and mediastinal and hilar mass, respectively (<i>P</i> < .001). Specificity increased with AI assistance (3.9% [95% CI: 3.2, 4.6], 3.7% [95% CI: 3, 4.4], 2.9% [95% CI: 2.3, 3.5], and 2.1% [95% CI: 1.6, 2.6] for pleural effusion, mediastinal and hilar mass, consolidation, and nodule, respectively), except in the diagnosis of pneumothorax (-0.2%; 95% CI: -0.36, -0.04; <i>P</i> = .01). The mean reading time was 81 seconds without AI versus 56 seconds with AI (31% decrease, <i>P</i> < .001). Conclusion AI-assisted chest radiography interpretation resulted in absolute increases in sensitivity for all radiologists of various levels of expertise and reduced the reading times; specificity increased with AI, except in the diagnosis of pneumothorax. \\u00a9 RSNA, 2023 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i>\"}},{\"_index\":\"pub_med\",\"_id\":\"axwrBI0BZKko4otC1atk\",\"_score\":1.0,\"_source\":{    \"id\": \"38084894\",    \"title\": \"Prognostic Value of a Novel Artificial Intelligence-Based Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography-Derived Ischemia Algorithm for Patients with Suspected Coronary Artery Disease.\",    \"text\": \"Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging is used to diagnose patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).

This study aimed to investigate the association between media exposure and longitudinal changes in executive function within a population-based study, while considering the potential influence of intelligence. This study used data from 1,209 participants in the Panel Korea Study for Children. The children's media exposure was measured at ages 7 and 8, and executive function was evaluated annually from ages 7 to 10 using the Executive Function Difficulty Screening Questionnaire. Participants were grouped by media exposure level (low, medium, or high), and longitudinal changes in executive function were analyzed using linear mixed effects models. Subgroup analysis was conducted to investigate how executive function changes varied based on intelligence within each media exposure group. Children with high media exposure (n = 97) had severer executive function difficulties than those with low (n = 141) or medium (n = 971) exposure in all waves. The high exposure group demonstrated persistent higher executive function difficulties up to age 10 after controlling for child gender, intelligence, parental education level and maternal depression. Children with intelligence quotient (IQ) â¤ 100 in the medium to high media exposure group had significantly more severe executive function difficulties than those with IQ > 100. This study provided evidence of a longitudinal negative association between media exposure and executive function. The findings suggest that excessive media exposure may lead to long-term changes in executive function in children and highlight the importance of implementing targeted interventions and educational strategies to mitigate the potential negative effects of excessive media use, particularly for children with lower cognitive abilities.\"}\n",

This statement is based on the assumption that the ability to master natural languages is the ultimate frontier for this new paradigm and perhaps an essential step to achieving the so-called general artificial intelligence. Autonomous knowledge generation implies that a machine will be able, for instance, to retrieve and understand the contents of the scientific literature and provide interpretations for existing data, allowing it to propose and address new scientific problems. While one may assume that the continued development of AI tools exploiting large-language models, with more data used for training, may lead these systems to learn autonomously, this learning can be accelerated by devising human-assisted strategies to deal with specific tasks. For example, strategies may be implemented for AI tools to emulate the analysis of multivariate data by human experts or in identifying and explaining patterns in temporal series. In addition to generic AI tools, such as Chat AIs, one may conceive personal AI agents, potentially working together, that are likely to serve end users in the near future. In this perspective paper, we discuss the development of this type of agent, focusing on its architecture and requirements. As a proof-of-concept, we exemplify how such an AI agent could work to assist researchers in materials sciences.'}\n",

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can help detect and quantify CAC/ASCVD which can lead to early treatment and improved outcomes. Using an FDA-approved algorithm (NANOX AI) to measure coronary artery calcium (CAC) on non-gated, non-contrast CT chest, 536 serial scans were evaluated in this single-center retrospective study. Scans were categorized by Agatston scores as normal-mild (<100), moderate (100-399), or severe (â¥400). AI results were validated by cardiologist's overread. Patient charts were retrospectively analyzed for clinical characteristics. Of the 527 patients included in this analysis, a total of 258 (48.96%) had moderate-severe disease; of these, 164 patients (63.57%, p< 0.001) had no previous diagnosis of CAD. Of those with moderate-severe disease 135 of 258 (52.33% p=0.006) were not on aspirin and 96 (37.21% p=0.093) were not on statin therapy. Cardiologist interpretation demonstrated 88.76% agreement with AI classification. Machine learning utilized in CT scans obtained for non-cardiac indications can detect and semi-quantitate CAC accurately. Artificial intelligence algorithms can accurately be applied to non-gated, non-contrast CT scans to identify CAC/ASCVD allowing for early medical intervention and improved clinical outcomes.\"}\n",

To effectively combat this crisis, it is crucial to discover better opioid drugs with reduced addiction potential. Artificial intelligence-based and other machine learning tools, particularly deep learning models, have garnered significant attention in recent years for their potential to advance drug discovery. However, using these tools poses challenges, especially when training samples are insufficient to achieve adequate prediction performance. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning in building robust deep learning models to enhance ligand bioactivity prediction for each individual opioid receptor (OR) subtype. This is achieved by leveraging knowledge obtained from pretraining a model using supervised learning on a larger data set of bioactivity data combined with ligand-based and structure-based molecular descriptors related to the entire OR subfamily. Our studies hold the potential to advance opioid research by enabling the rapid identification of novel chemical probes with specific bioactivities, which can aid in the study of receptor function and contribute to the future development of improved opioid therapeutics.'}\n",

But they still cannot outperform many artificial neural networks. Modularity is another crucial feature of the biological brain. It remains unclear if modularity can also improve the performance of SNNs. To investigate this idea, we proposed the modular SNN, and compared its performance with a uniform SNN without modularity by employing them to classify cortical spike trains. For the first time, a significant improvement was found in our modular SNN. Further, we probed into the factors influencing the performance of the modular SNN and found: (a). The modular SNN outperformed the uniform SNN more significantly when the number of neurons in the networks increased; (b). The performance of the modular SNNs increased as the number of modules dropped. These preliminary but novel findings suggest that modularity may help develop better artificial intelligence and brain-machine interfaces. Also, the modular SNN may serve as a model for the study of neuronal spike synchrony.'}\n",

Stethoscope-recorded lung sounds and artificial intelligence-powered devices have been used to identify lung disorders and aid specialists in making accurate diagnoses. In this study, audio-spectrogram vision transformer (AS-ViT), a new approach for identifying abnormal respiration sounds, was developed. The sounds of the lungs are converted into visual representations called spectrograms using a technique called short-time Fourier transform (STFT). These images are then analyzed using a model called vision transformer to identify different types of respiratory sounds. The classification was carried out using the ICBHI 2017 database, which includes various types of lung sounds with different frequencies, noise levels, and backgrounds. The proposed AS-ViT method was evaluated using three metrics and achieved 79.1% and 59.8% for 60:40 split ratio and 86.4% and 69.3% for 80:20 split ratio in terms of unweighted average recall and overall scores respectively for respiratory sound detection, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.'}\n",

In the present study, the COD removal efficiency (COD<sub>RE</sub>) (%) and lipid concentration (g/L) were predicted using two artificial intelligence models, i.e., an artificial neural network (ANN) and a neuro-fuzzy neural network (NF-NN) with a network topology of 6-25-2 being the best for NF-NN. The results revealed the superiority of NF-NN over ANN in terms of determination coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Three learning algorithms were tested with NF-NN; among them, the Bayesian regularization backpropagation (BR-BP) outperformed others.
