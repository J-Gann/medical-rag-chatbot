      "{'id': '38217783', 'title': 'Towards a dynamic, comprehensive conceptualization of dyslexia.', 'text': 'Here we build from the central strength of the existing definition of dyslexia-its emphasis on neurobiological origins-and proffer a set of seven core principles for a new, more comprehensive conceptualization of dyslexia. These principles derive from two major research directions: (1) the still evolving history of attempts to explain dyslexia, including in varied writing systems; and (2) the study of the reading brain circuit, its development, and its genetic and environmental influences. What emerges from connecting these two directions is a dynamic conceptualization of dyslexia that incorporates the extensive research on the heterogeneity of dyslexia and the interdependent contributions of multiple biological and socio-cultural risk and preventive factors. A new definition of dyslexia, therefore, needs to transcend both past unitary characterizations and past assumptions based largely on the English orthography. Such a conceptualization references the ways that different languages interact with the reading brain circuit to produce different sources of reading failure. Similarly, the characteristics and consequences of dyslexia that have been considered as secondary sequela (e.g., reduced reading comprehension, social-emotional issues) should be part of a more comprehensive narrative. Of critical importance, any definition of dyslexia should clarify persisting misconceptions that associate dyslexia with a lack of intelligence, potential to learn, or talents. Thus, the overall purpose of such a definition should serve as an instrument of knowledge and an enduring reason for pursuing growth in reading for the individual, the educator, and the public.'}\n",

Organoids bridge the gaps between conventional drug screening models such as planar mammalian cell culture, animal studies, and clinical trials. They can revolutionize the fields of developmental biology, neuroscience, toxicology, and computer engineering. Conventional microinstrumentation for conventional cellular engineering, such as planar microfluidic chips; microelectrode arrays (MEAs), and optical, magnetic, and acoustic techniques, have limitations when applied to 3D organoids, primarily due to their limits with inherently 2D geometry and interfacing. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop new instrumentation that is compatible with live cell culture techniques and with scalable 3D formats of relevance to organoids. This review discusses conventional planar approaches and emerging 3D microinstrumentation necessary for advanced organoid-machine interfaces. Specifically, the article surveys recently developed microinstrumentation, including 3D printed and curved microfluidics, 3D and fast-scan optical techniques, buckling and self-folding microelectrode arrays, 3D interfaces for electrochemical measurements, and 3D spatially controllable magnetic and acoustic technologies relevant to two-way information transfer with brain organoids.

When using traditional hydrogel dressings, they are easy to crack and undergo bacterial infection, difficult to match and monitor the irregular wounds. Integrating multiple functions within a hydrogel dressing to achieve intelligent wound monitoring and healing remains a significant challenge. In this research, we develop a multifunctional hydrogel based on polysaccharide biopolymer, poly(vinyl alcohol), and hydroxylated graphene through dynamic borate ester bonding and supramolecular interaction. The prepared hydrogel not only exhibits rapid self-healing (within 60 s), injectable, conductive and motion monitoring properties, but also realizes in situ bacterial sensing and killing functions. It shows excellent bacterial sensitivity (within 15\\xa0min) and killing ability via the changes of electrical signals and photothermal therapy, avoiding the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. In vivo experiments prove that the hydrogel can promote wound healing effectively. In addition, it displays great electromechanical performance to achieve real-time monitoring and prevent re-tearing of the wound at human joints. The injectable pH-responsive hydrogel with good biocompatibility demonstrates considerable potential as multifunctional bioelectronic dressing for the detection, treatment, management and healing of infected joint wounds.

To illustrate, we implemented this model in a non-gradient-based machine learning algorithm to train deep neural networks called essence neural networks (ENNs). Neural information processing in ENNs is intrinsically explainable, even on benchmark computer vision tasks. ENNs can also simulate higher cognitive functions such as deliberation, symbolic reasoning and out-of-distribution generalization.

The prediction of GS models is based on the mathematical relation between genotypic and phenotypic data from the training population. ML techniques have emerged as powerful tools for genome editing through analysing large-scale genomic data and facilitating the development of accurate prediction models. Precise phenotyping is a prerequisite to advance crop breeding for solving agricultural production-related issues. ML algorithms can solve this problem through generating predictive models, based on the analysis of large-scale phenotypic datasets.

Regarding the distinctively upregulated fibronectin (FN1) and tenascin C (TNC) in tumor stroma, we herein design a protease-activated FN1 and/or TNC binding peptide (FTF) and propose an extracellular matrix (ECM)-trapped bioinspired lipoprotein (BL) (FTF-BL-CP) that can be preferentially captured by the TNC and/or FN1 for tumor retention, and then be responsively dissociated from the matrix to potentiate the antitumor immunity. The FTF-BL-CP treatment produces a 6.96-, 9.24-, 6.72-, 7.32-, and 6.73-fold increase of CD3+ CD8+ T cells and their interferon-Î³-, granzyme B-, perforin-, and Ki67-expressing subtypes versus the negative control, thereby profoundly eliciting the antitumor immunity. In orthotopic and lung metastatic breast cancer models, FTF-BL-CP produced notable therapeutic benefits of retarding tumor growth, extending survivals, and inhibiting lung metastasis. Therefore, this ECM-trapping strategy provides an encouraging possibility of prolonging tumor retention to potentiate the antitumor immunity for anticancer immunotherapy.

However, the potential risks remain unclear. We investigated the effects of CDHFD in adult mice and explored the mechanisms of action. Twenty adult male mice were randomly divided into control and model groups, and the control group was fed a normal diet, whereas the model group was fed CDHFD for 28 days. We found that mice in the model group developed diarrhea symptoms accompanied by fatigue and weakness. Analysis of the intestinal flora revealed that the model group had a lower diversity and richness of microorganism species in the gut than the control group. Furthermore, the characteristic analysis indicated that CDHFD downregulated specific bacteria, such as norank_f_Muribaculaceae, Muribaculum, and Odoribacter, which are known to be associated with the systemic inflammatory response and mucosal barrier function. Blood tests showed that immune cells and inflammatory cytokines were significantly elevated in the model group, along with increased LPS induced by CDHFD. Pathological investigations demonstrated that CDHFD damages the intestinal mucosa while affecting the expression of tight junction proteins, including ZO-1, Claudin-1, Claudin-2, and Occludin, which may be attributed to the activation of the TRAF6/IÎºB/p65 signaling pathway. In conclusion, impaired gut microbial and mechanical barrier function is responsible for CDHFD-induced diarrhea. In this study, we constructed a model of diet-induced diarrhea by simulating human dietary patterns, evaluated the long-term effects of CDHFD on human intestinal barriers and immune systems, and revealed its mechanism of action based on chronic inflammation. This study validated the model's fit to provide an effective screening model for drug or functional food development.\"}\n",

TA profoundly impacts both central and autonomic nervous systems, presenting as a dual manifestation of cognitive and autonomic components. While limited studies have explored the physiological underpinnings of TA, none have directly investigated the intricate interplay between the CNS and ANS in this context. In this study, we introduce a non-invasive, integrated neuro-cardiovascular approach to comprehensively characterize the physiological responses of 27 healthy subjects subjected to test anxiety induced via a simulated exam scenario. Our experimental findings highlight that an isolated analysis of electroencephalographic and heart rate variability data fails to capture the intricate information provided by a brain-heart axis assessment, which incorporates an analysis of the dynamic interaction between the brain and heart. With respect to resting state, the simulated examination induced a decrease in the neural control onto heartbeat dynamics at all frequencies, while the studying condition induced a decrease in the ascending heart-to-brain interplay at EEG oscillations up to 12Hz. This underscores the significance of adopting a multisystem perspective in understanding the complex and especially functional directional mechanisms underlying test anxiety.'}\n"

      "{'id': '38215710', 'title': 'Mechanical Ventilation, Past, Present, and Future.', 'text': 'Mechanical ventilation (MV) has played a crucial role in the medical field, particularly in anesthesia and in critical care medicine (CCM) settings. MV has evolved significantly since its inception over 70 years ago and the future promises even more advanced technology. In the past, ventilation was provided manually, intermittently, and it was primarily used for resuscitation or as a last resort for patients with severe respiratory or cardiovascular failure. The earliest MV machines for prolonged ventilatory support and oxygenation were large and cumbersome. They required a significant amount of skills and expertise to operate. These early devices had limited capabilities, battery, power, safety features, alarms, and therefore these often caused harm to patients. Moreover, the physiology of MV was modified when mechanical ventilators moved from negative pressure to positive pressure mechanisms. Monitoring systems were also very limited and therefore the risks related to MV support were difficult to quantify, predict and timely detect for individual patients who were necessarily young with few comorbidities. Technology and devices designed to use tracheostomies versus endotracheal intubation evolved in the last century too and these are currently much more reliable. In the present, positive pressure MV is more sophisticated and widely used for extensive period of time. Modern ventilators use mostly positive pressure systems and are much smaller, more portable than their predecessors, and they are much easier to operate. They can also be programmed to provide different levels of support based on evolving physiological concepts allowing lung-protective ventilation. Monitoring systems are more sophisticated and knowledge related to the physiology of MV is improved. Patients are also more complex and elderly compared to the past. MV experts are informed about risks related to prolonged or aggressive ventilation modalities and settings. One of the most significant advances in MV has been protective lung ventilation, diaphragm protective ventilation including noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Health care professionals are familiar with the use of MV and in many countries, respiratory therapists have been trained for the exclusive purpose of providing safe and professional respiratory support to critically ill patients. Analgo-sedation drugs and techniques are improved, and more sedative drugs are available and this has an impact on recovery, weaning, and overall patients\\' outcome. Looking toward the future, MV is likely to continue to evolve and improve alongside monitoring techniques and sedatives. There is increasing precision in monitoring global \"patient-ventilator\" interactions: structure and analysis (asynchrony, desynchrony, etc). One area of development is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in ventilator technology. AI can be used to monitor patients in real-time, and it can predict when a patient is likely to experience respiratory distress. This allows medical professionals to intervene before a crisis occurs, improving patient outcomes and reducing the need for emergency intervention. This specific area of development is intended as \"personalized ventilation.\" It involves tailoring the ventilator settings to the individual patient, based on their physiology and the specific condition they are being treated for. This approach has the potential to improve patient outcomes by optimizing ventilation and reducing the risk of harm. In conclusion, MV has come a long way since its inception, and it continues to play a critical role in anesthesia and in CCM settings. Advances in technology have made MV safer, more effective, affordable, and more widely available. As technology continues to improve, more advanced and personalized MV will become available, leading to better patients\\' outcomes and quality of life for those in need.'}\n"

Since their introduction, their use in the perioperative setting has continued to evolve, and we are now on the brink of automated administration. IV fluid therapy was first described in Scotland during the 1832 cholera epidemic, when pioneers in medicine saved critically ill patients dying from hypovolemic shock. However, widespread use of IV fluids only began in the 20th century. Epinephrine was discovered and purified in the United States at the end of the 19th century, but its short half-life limited its implementation into patient care. Advances in venous access, including the introduction of the central venous catheter, and the ability to administer continuous infusions of fluids and vasopressors rather than just boluses, facilitated the use of fluids and adrenergic agents. With the advent of advanced hemodynamic monitoring, most notably the pulmonary artery catheter, the role of fluids and vasopressors in the maintenance of tissue oxygenation through adequate cardiac output and perfusion pressure became more clearly established, and hemodynamic goals could be established to better titrate fluid and vasopressor therapy. Less invasive hemodynamic monitoring techniques, using echography, pulse contour analysis, and heart-lung interactions, have facilitated hemodynamic monitoring at the bedside. Most recently, advances have been made in closed-loop fluid and vasopressor therapy, which apply computer assistance to interpret hemodynamic variables and therapy. Development and increased use of artificial intelligence will likely represent a major step toward fully automated hemodynamic management in the perioperative environment in the near future. In this narrative review, we discuss the key events in experimental medicine that have led to the current status of fluid and vasopressor therapies and describe the potential benefits that future automation has to offer.'}\n",

However, existing methods either have limitations based on prior knowledge or are invasive methods. To propose a more generalized severity evaluation model, this paper proposes an explainable 3D multi-head attention residual convolution network. First, we introduce the 3D attention-based convolution layer to extract video features. Second, features will be fed into LSTM and residual backbone networks, which can be used to capture the contextual information of the video. Finally, we design a feature compression module to condense the learned contextual features. We develop some interpretable experiments to better explain this black-box model so that it can be better generalized. Experiments show that our model can achieve state-of-the-art diagnosis performance. The proposed lightweight but effective model is expected to serve as a suitable end-to-end deep learning baseline in future research on PD video-based severity evaluation and has the potential for large-scale application in PD telemedicine.

The linear relationships of transmittance and reflectance with chlorophyll content were investigated.

The partial least squares regression (PLSR) models for predicting the chlorophyll content were established using the full spectra and extracted FWs. The results showed that there were obvious linear relationships between transmittance and reflectance with chlorophyll content of maize leaves and the best linear relationships were found at 709\\xa0nm and 714\\xa0nm, respectively, with the linear correlation coefficients of 0.801 and 0.696, and the root-mean-squares error (RMSEP) of 0.321\\xa0mgÂ·g-1 and 0.405\\xa0mgÂ·g-1, respectively. Eight and 6 FWs were extracted from the transmittance and reflectance spectra, respectively. The PLSR model established using the selected FWs from transmittance spectra had better prediction performance with RMSEP of 0.208\\xa0mgÂ·g-1 than using full transmittance spectra. The built PLSR models using the full reflectance spectra and extracted FWs had poor robustness.

However, there is no clear consensus as to whether reduced intelligibility leads to a decrease or an increase in cortical speech tracking, warranting further investigation of the factors influencing this relationship. One such factor is listening effort, defined as the cognitive resources necessary for speech comprehension, and reported to have a strong negative correlation with speech intelligibility. Yet, no studies have examined the relationship between speech intelligibility, listening effort, and cortical tracking of speech. The aim of the present study was thus to examine these factors in quiet and distinct adverse listening conditions. Forty-nine normal hearing adults listened to sentences produced casually, presented in quiet and two adverse listening conditions: cafeteria noise and reverberant speech. Electrophysiological responses were registered with electroencephalogram, and listening effort was estimated subjectively using self-reported scores and objectively using pupillometry. Results indicated varying impacts of adverse conditions on intelligibility, listening effort, and cortical tracking of speech, depending on the preservation of the speech temporal envelope. The more distorted envelope in the reverberant condition led to higher listening effort, as reflected in higher subjective scores, increased pupil diameter, and stronger cortical tracking of speech in the delta band. These findings suggest that using measures of listening effort in addition to those of intelligibility is useful for interpreting cortical tracking of speech results. Moreover, reading and phonological skills of participants were positively correlated with listening effort in the cafeteria condition, suggesting a special role of expert language skills in processing speech in this noisy condition. Implications for future research and theories linking atypical cortical tracking of speech and reading disorders are further discussed.'}\n",

To this end, we propose a flexible resource scheduling (FRES) framework by employing a novel deep progressive reinforcement learning that includes the following innovations. First, a novel multitask agent is presented to deal with the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The multitask agent has two output heads designed for different tasks, in which a classified head is employed to make offloading decisions with integer variables while a fitting head is applied to solve resource allocation with continuous variables. Second, a progressive scheduler is introduced to adapt the agent to the varying number of UAVs by progressively adjusting a part of neurons in the agent. This structure can naturally accumulate experiences and be immune to catastrophic forgetting. Finally, a light taboo search (LTS) is introduced to enhance the global search of the FRES.

      "{'id': '38215213', 'title': 'Magnetic Microbead-Based Herringbone Chip for Sensitive Detection of Human Immunodeficiency Virus.', 'text': 'The microfluidic chip-based nucleic acid detection method significantly improves the sensitivity since it precisely controls the microfluidic flow in microchannels. Nonetheless, significant challenges still exist in improving the detection efficiency to meet the demand for rapid detection of trace substances. This work provides a novel magnetic herringbone (M-HB) structure in a microfluidic chip, and its advantage in rapid and sensitive detection is verified by taking complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) detection as an example. The M-HB structure is designed based on controlling the magnetic field distribution in the micrometer scale and is formed by accumulation of magnetic microbeads (MMBs). Hence, M-HB is similar to a nanopore microstructure, which has a higher contact area and probe density. All of the above is conducive to improving sensitivity in microfluidic chips. The M-HB chip is stable and easy to form, which can linearly detect cDNA sequences of HIV quantitatively ranging from 1 to 20 nM with a detection limit of 0.073 nM. Compared to the traditional herringbone structure, this structure is easier to form and release by controlling the magnetic field, which is flexible and helps in further study. Results show that this chip can sensitively detect the cDNA sequences of HIV in blood samples, demonstrating that it is a powerful platform to rapidly and sensitively detect multiple nucleic acid-related viruses of infectious diseases.'}\n",

However, there is still a lack of adequate quantification and analysis of publications in this field. The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of publications related to intestinal polyps over the past 20 years. To enhance the understanding of current research hotspots and potential trends, and to point out the direction of future research. Publications related to intestinal polyps were retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded in Web of Science Core Collection. the Bibliometric online analysis platform (https://bibliometric.com/app), the Bibliometrix Package, and the CiteSpace are used for bibliometric analysis and visualization, including the overall range of annual output and annual citations, country-region analysis, author and institution analysis, core journal analysis, reference and keyword analysis. Prior to 2017, the amount of research on intestinal polyps was slow to grow, but it picked up speed after that year. In 1019 journals, 4280 papers on intestinal polyps were published in English. The journal with the highest productivity was Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (189, 4.42%). United States (1124, 26.26%), which is also the hub of collaboration in this subject, was the most productive nation. Mayo Clinic (n\\u2005=\\u200570, 1.64%) is the most productive institution. Intestinal microbiota, endoscopic mucosal resection, gut microbiota, deep learning, tea polyphenol, insulin resistance and artificial intelligence were current hot subjects in the field. Studies of intestinal polyps increased significantly after 2017. The United States contributed the largest number of publications. Countries and institutions were actively cooperating with one another. artificial intelligence is currently an emerging topic.'}\n",

Due to the complexity of optics in water bodies, it is difficult to accurately predict Chl-a concentrations in water bodies by current traditional methods. In this paper, using Sentinel-2 remote sensing images as the data source combined with measured data, taking Wuliangsu Lake as the study area, a new intelligent algorithm is proposed for prediction of Chl-a concentration, which uses the adaptive ant colony exhaustive optimization algorithm (A-ACEO) for feature selection and the gray wolf optimization algorithm (GWO) to optimize support vector regression (SVR) to achieve Chl-a concentration prediction. The ant colony optimization algorithm is improved to select remote sensing feature bands for Chl-a concentration by introducing relevant optimization strategies. The GWO-SVR model is built by optimizing SVR using GWO with the selected feature bands as input and comparing it with the traditional SVR model. The results show that the usage of feature bands selected by the presented A-ACEO algorithm as inputs can effectively reduce complexity and improve the prediction performance of the model, under the condition of the same model, which can provide valuable references for monitoring the Chl-a concentration in Wuliangsu Lake.'}\n"

However, due to various obstacles such as the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) and the blood-brain barrier (BBB), few nanocarriers can achieve brain-targeting through oral administration. Herein, an intelligent oral brain-targeting nanoparticle (FTY@Man NP) constructed from a PLGA-PEG skeleton loaded with fingolimod (FTY) and externally modified with mannose was designed in combination with a glucose control strategy for the multitarget treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hydrophilic and electronegative properties of the nanoparticle facilitated its facile penetration through the mucus barrier, while the mannose ligand conferred IEB targeting abilities to the nanoparticle. Subsequently, glycemic control allowed the mannose-integrated nanoparticle to hitchhike the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) circulation across the BBB. Finally, the released FTY modulated the polarity of microglia from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 and normalized the activated astrocyte, enhancing the clearance of toxic protein Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) while alleviating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Notably, both in vitro and in vivo results have consistently demonstrated that the oral administration of FTY@Man NP could effectively traverse the multiple barriers, thereby exerting significant therapeutic effects. This breakthrough holds the promise of realizing a highly effective orally administered treatment for AD.\"}\n",
