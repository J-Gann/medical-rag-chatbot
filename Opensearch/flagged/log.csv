"Cigarettes?

","Alexithymia can be associated with worse addictive traits, while emotional intelligence is associated with better addictive outcomes. In Lebanon, the prevalence of cigarette and waterpipe smoking is on the rise, although people are aware of the associated harms. Also, around 11% of Lebanese adults have experienced alcohol use disorder (AUD). This study aimed to assess the association between alexithymia, emotional intelligence, smoking (cigarette and waterpipe), and AUD among a sample of Lebanese adults. A web-based cross-sectional study carried out between February and April 2020, during the lockdown period, enrolled 408 community-dwelling adults. The survey link was shared on social media to reach participants from all Lebanese districts/governorates. Taking antidepressants (Beta = 4.37) was significantly associated with more cigarette dependence, while female gender (Beta = -1.52) and having a high vs. low monthly income (Beta = 1.02) were significantly associated with less cigarette dependence. None of the variables, including alexithymia, were significantly associated with waterpipe dependence. Female gender (Beta = -0.15) and higher emotional intelligence (Beta = -0.003) were significantly associated with less AUD, whereas higher alexithymia (Beta = 0.003) was significantly associated with more AUD. This study could demonstrate a significant association between alexithymia and cigarette smoking and alexithymia and alcohol consumption. Future research is warranted to investigate the mediating effect of emotional intelligence and how these results may be used to meet the needs of alexithymic individuals with addictions.",,,2024-02-10 16:54:23.218144
